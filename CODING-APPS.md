## Making model files

Place a file named `dataModel.js` in `mvc/models`.

Here's a simple example `dataModel.js` data model:

```js
// dataModel.js
module.exports = () => {
  return { some: 'data' }
}
```

In more complex apps, you might query a database to get your data instead.

## Making view files

Views by default are [Teddy](https://rooseveltframework.org/docs/teddy) templates. See the Teddy documentation for information about how to write Teddy templates.

You can also configure Roosevelt to use any templating system supported by Express for your views.

## Making controller files

Controller files are places to write [Express routes](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#router). A route is the term Express uses for URL endpoints, such as `https://yoursite/blog` or `https://yoursite/about`.

Controllers bind models and views together.

To make a new controller, make a new file in the controllers directory, then follow one of the examples below.

### Example GET route

```js
// someController.js
module.exports = (router, app) => {
  // router is an Express router
  // and app is the Express app created by Roosevelt

  // standard Express route
  router.route('/about').get((req, res) => {
    // load a data model
    const model = require('models/dataModel')()

    // render a template and pass it the model
    res.render('about', model)
  })
}
```

### Example POST route

In Roosevelt, [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) protection is enabled by default. That means in order to make requests to any POST route, you will need to pass a CSRF token from the server to the browser, and then return that token when making a request from the browser to the server.

To do that, include the CSRF token in your HTML form as a hidden input `_csrf`:

```js
// someController.js
module.exports = (router, app) => {
  router.route('/form').get((req, res) => {
    const model = require('models/dataModel')()
    model.csrfToken = req.csrfToken() // add CSRF token to the model
    res.render('about', model)
  })
}
```

```html
<!-- form that include the token in a request body -->
<form action="/some-protected-endpoint" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="{csrfToken}">
</form>
```

You can also add the token as a request header when performing fetch requests by setting the `x-csrf-token` header:

```javascript
// request that includes the token in headers
const response = await fetch('/some-protected-endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'X-CSRF-TOKEN': csrfToken // extract it from the DOM or something
  }
})
```

You can also exempt certain routes from CSRF protection or disable the feature entirely by configuration. See configuration section for details.

### Reusable controllers

Sometimes it is also useful to separate controller logic from your routing. This can be done by creating a reusable controller module. Reusable controller modules differ from standard controller modules in that they are meant to be called from within other controllers and do not define routes.

To create a reusable controller, put a file in your controllers directory that accepts `app`, `req`, and `res` arguments with logic that is meant to execute from within a predefined route.

An example of when this might be needed would be having a reusable controller for "404 Not Found" pages:

```js
// notFound.js â€” reusable controller
module.exports = (app, req, res) => {
  const model = { content: 'Cannot find this page' }
  res.status(404)
  res.render('404', model)
}
```

You can then call the reusable controller in any other controller when needed:

```js
// someController.js
module.exports = (router, app) => {
  router.route('/whatever').get((req, res) => {
    // test some logic that could fail
    // thus triggering the need for the 404 controller
    if (something) {
      // logic didn't fail
      // so render the page normally
      let model = require('models/dataModel')
      res.render('whatever', model)
    }
    else {
      // logic failed
      // so throw the 404 by executing your reusable controller
      require('controllers/notFound')(app, req, res)
    }
  })
}
```

Any controller file that has no arguments or more than two arguments will be considered a reusable controller.

## Making static pages

You can also generate static files from templates and models as well.

Templates for static pages go in your statics folder (`staticsRoot`) under the HTML source path (`html.sourcePath`), which is `statics/pages` by default.

Data models for the templates will be merged from different possible locations to source them from in the following order of precedence:

1. `*` model in `htmlModels`.
2. File-level override in `htmlModels`.
3. Model file.

### Setting static page models

To declare a global model in `htmlModels`, use the `*` character:

```javascript
// build.js
(async () => {
  await require('roosevelt')({
    html: {
      models: {
        '*': {
          hello: 'world!'
        }
      }
    }
  }).init()
})()
```

To declare a model for a specific file in `htmlModels`:

```javascript
// build.js
(async () => {
  await require('roosevelt')({
    html: {
      models: {
        'index.html': {
          hello: 'world!'
        }
      }
    }
  }).init()
})()
```

You can also declare a model for a specific page by placing a JS file with the same name alongside the template.

For example if an `index.js` file exists next to `index.html`, the JS file will be used to set the model so long as it exports either an object or a function that returns an object.
